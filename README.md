# News Page

Tools used:

-HTML

-CSS

Summary:

This was just a simple mobile responsive news page with an interactible header, and interactible news links. I got to practice with my CSS some more especially CSS Grid which was pretty helpful because I normally don't use it, so this was a good learning experience for me I'd say.
